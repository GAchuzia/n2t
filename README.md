# Attempting Nand To Tetris

Nand to Tetris (aka The Elements of Computing Systems) is a book and course teaching the fundamentals of computation by building a modern computer.

The series is broken up into two parts; a hardware and software section. Each part has 6 sections covering an important element of computers.

### Hardware

[1. Boolean Logic](Hardware/Project&#32;1/boolean_logic.md)  
[2. Boolean Arithmetic](Hardware/Project&#32;2/boolean_arithmetic.md)  
[3. Memory](Hardware/Project&#32;3/memory.md)  
[4. Machine Language](Hardware/Project&#32;4/machine_language.md)  
[5. Computer Architecture](Hardware/Project&#32;5/computer_architecture.md)  
[6. Assembler](Hardware/Project&#32;6/assembler.md)  

### Software

[7. Virtual Machine I: Processing](Software/Project&#32;7/virtual_machine_i.md)  
[8. Virtual Machine II: Control](Software/Project&#32;8/virtual_machine_ii.md)  
[9.  High-Level Language](Software/Project&#32;9/high_level_language.md)  
[10. Compiler I: Syntax Analysis](Software/Project&#32;10/compiler_i.md)
[11. Compiler II: Code Generation](Software/Project&#32;11/compiler_ii.md)  
[12. Operating System](Software/Project&#32;12/operating_systems.md)  

I'm going to *try* and write brief notes as well as journal my experience as I go through the course. I'll also try and maintain clean and readable code.
